Modified version of the Inclusion of Other in Self Scale.

Includes 5 response options, with circles which become closer and eventually touch 
  - circles closer together indicate greater social closeness

Each response option has two circles, and has a different colour box around it. The order of boxes are as follows:
 1. green (circles are far apart)
 2. blue
 3. red
 4. brown
 5. pink (circles are just about touching)
